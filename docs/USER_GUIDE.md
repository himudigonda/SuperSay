# 📖 User Guide

Welcome to **SuperSay**. This guide will help you get the most out of your cinematic TTS utility.

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

SuperSay is designed to be used without leaving your current application.

| Action | Shortcut | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

## 🛠️ Configuring the Experience

### Voice Selection

Choose between a variety of voices. **🇺🇸 Bella** and **🇺🇸 Sarah** are optimized for long-form reading, while **am_michael** and **am_adam** offer an authoritative tone.

### Audio Environment
* **Duck Music Volume**: When enabled, SuperSay will automatically lower the volume of Spotify or Apple Music while it speaks. It will smoothly fade the music back once it's finished.

## 💾 The Vault

All text you speak is automatically logged in **The Vault**. 
* **Search**: Use the search bar to find previous clips.
* **Replay**: Click any entry to re-generate and listen to it again.
* **Favorites**: Star important clips to keep them at the top.
